## Get Started (Integrate to Your Project)

1. It's simple. Let's add that into your project:

    ```bash
    yarn add @intellihr/ui-components react react-dom foundation-sites jquery styled-components
    # or
    npm i @intellihr/ui-components react react-dom foundation-sites jquery styled-components
    ```

2. Then included the project css and this project's components css into your project's entry point. e.g. in CRA, it's the `index.js`:

    ```javascript
    import '@intellihr/ui-components/dist/index.css'
    import '@intellihr/ui-components/dist/ui-components.css'
    ```

3. Make sure your project knows how to handle css file type, which is quite simple if you use webpack(and normally your project should have already setup):

    ```javascript
    {
      test: /\.css$/,
      use: [
        require.resolve('style-loader'),
        {
          loader: require.resolve('css-loader')
        }
      ]
    }

    ```

4. Then you could start using the components! Test out by:

    ```javascript
    import { Callout } from '@intellihr/ui-components'

    <Callout type="info">
      <div className="title">
      Information!
      </div>
      Bringing you the lasted news.
    </Callout>
    ```

## Local Development Guide

### Contributing

Please check our [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) before contribute.

It contains all the coding standard and other important information in regards to contributing.

### Yarn Link Issue

#### Classnames generated by styled-components in the snapshots of my project are broken

This is caused by two styled-components being loaded during the test of your project.

Please follow the steps below.

1. Remove `styled-components` in `devDependencies` of the ui-components package.json
2. run `yarn build:watch`
3. Proceed normal yarn link procedure
4. Revert changes in package.json and yarn.lock before commit

This will force the root library to use its own `styled-components` dependency.

Webpack has issue to import `peerDependencies` when they are:

1. `dependencies` of the root project
2. both `peerDependencies` and `devDependencies` at the same time in the child project

This will cause webpack to import the `devDependencies` in the child project but not the root project
which causes the same package imported twice (one in root, another one in child)

#### UI-Components does not seem to be updated correctly

This usually causes the following errors

```
An unexpected error occurred: "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@types%2fintellihr__ui-components: Not found"
```

It is caused by the cache of the loaders. Simply run

```bash
rm -rf ./node_modules/.cache/
```

Then rebuild your project

### Styleguide Issues

#### Styleguide uses wrong name for components

Styleguidist uses source code inspection to figure out component names and proptypes. This can cause
names to be incorrect depending upon how your source code is formatted. e.g.

```typescript
const Component = styled(Thing)

export {
  Component
}
```

will give `StyledComponentClass` as the name for the component, rather than `Component`.
You can usually fix this by exporting the component where it is defined:

```typescript
export const Component = styled(Thing)
```

### Typescript Issues

#### Files with only type/interface do not generate .d.ts files

Github issue: https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader/issues/432

Files containing only an interface will not be built by awesome-typescript-loader.
If you have a file with only a type/interface you will need to add and export a dummy variable to trick the loader into generating the file.

```typescript
interface a {}
const b = {}

export { a, b }
```


### Path Mapping in Typescript

Path Mapping refers the following path aliases

```typescript
import { XXX } from '@Domain/XXX'
import { YYY } from '@Common/YYY'
```

These are available only in `.examples.md` or `.test.tsx` files.

We do not use path mapping in Typescript file (i.e. `.ts` or `.tsx`).

The reason is [Here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/16640)

As we need to output type definitions to our Typescript consumer (e.g. SPA),
using path mapping will result in wrong mapping because typescript complier does not re-write the path.

This only applies to libraries.
For other Typescript projects, there is no issue with using path mapping since no consumers care about the type definition.

### Add Dependency

For Details Check [Here](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2016/08/24/understanding-the-npm-dependency-model/)

![Dependency Mind Map](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vg0quZCNcOvm7vz10rIK6WFqmIH_VHy3)

#### Add `devDependencies`

    ```bash
    yarn add -D some-library
    ```

#### Add `dependencies`

    ```bash
    yarn add -E some-library
    ```

#### Add `peerDependencies`

1. Add `devDependencies`

    ```bash
    yarn add -D some-library
    ```

2. Update `package.json` to add `peerDependencies`

    ```json
    {
      "devDependencies": {
        "some-library": "^1.0.0"
      },
      "peerDependencies": {
        "some-library": "^1.0.0"
      }
    }
    ```

3. Update `README.md` the [Get Started](#get-started-integrate-to-your-project) session
to include your library in the install command

4. Update your consumer to include your `peerDependencies`

    ```bash
    npm i --save-dev some-library
    # or
    yarn add -D some-library
    ```

### Docker

#### Build Imange

```bash
docker-compose build --force-rm code
# or without mounting node_module
docker-composer build --force-rm code-mac
```

#### Run Inside Docker

```bash
docker-compose run --rm code /bin/sh
# or without mounting node_module
docker-composer run --rm code-mac /bin/sh
```

### Install Dependency

```bash
yarn
```

### Development

To preview the components,
we could write a example usage in the Markdown file
with JSX syntax in the component folder, e.g. `Callout.examples.md`

```jsx
<Callout type="info">
  <div className="title">
  Information!
  </div>
  Bringing you the lasted news.
</Callout>
```

Some development points:

* Tests are written in `.test.tsx` of each component `.tsx` file

* [No default export](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/no-default-export/)

* This project is developed with Typescript

### Lint

Typescript Style Check

```bash
yarn lint
```

with autofix

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

Sass Style Check

```bash
yarn lint:sass
```

Sass Style Autofix

```bash
yarn lint:sass:fix
```

Styled-Components Check

```bash
yarn lint:css
```

### Code Quality Analysis

```bash
yarn codequality
```

It will then generate `.codeclimate/codeclimate.html`
(Note: This takes time)

## Customisation

If you need a customised e.g. `Callout` component, you could do something like:

```typescript
import { Callout } from '@intellihr/ui-components'
class MyCallout extends React.SFC<MyCalloutProps> {
  render() {
    // ... some of your logic...
    return <Callout {...myLogic} />
  }
}
```
